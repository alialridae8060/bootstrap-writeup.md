## Text Below:How have I processed Bootstrap so far?

### I have processed bootstrap in the equivalency of approaching mastery at best.I will explian when we started with bootstrap with the bootstrap grid practice which we started with breakpoints,containers and container fluids,columns and rows and what I learned them fairly easily and hear are hat I know about them:
   ### <ul> 
### <li>  Breakpoints are basically digital auto adjusters that would auto adjust the foundation of the website in order to make it perfectly viewable on any and all devices being used.</li>
### <li>The difference between container and container fluids is that containers would have the max width change after each breakpoint while container fluid would have 100% width at all breakpoints.</li> 
### <li>Correct indentations are so important when doing bootstrap as they help make the output of the code more readable and reliable.</li>
### <li>Col-size-number is for the size of devices as for example with col-md-4 it works when a device is medium or larger than 768 pixels and their maximum width of the container would be 720 pixels which would divide it up into four equal columns that are medium or larger than 192 pixels and their maximum width is 180 pixels.</li>
### <li>The purpose for giving a div multiple col classes in example col-md-6 and col-xxl-3 is to program a code for responsive layout in the website that would allow the website to adapt to different screen and device sizes either like my iphone 15 or my school issued Chromebook or the smart boards in school.</li>
### <li>A container can be inside a container-fluid in website programming and coding.</li>
###  </ul>
### The first five of bootstrap were easy.The next are the gridpractices for the componets which were all hard to complete but I was able to get through non the less here are the code pieces of all the challenges.

### First the bootstrap-grid-practice:

### <ul>
### <li>  <h1>You hungry for what ?</h1>
       <div class="containerfluid">

            <div class="container">
             .container{
                background-color:darkblue;
                border: 1px;
             }
                <div class="rows">
                    <div class=col-xs-2 col-sm-4 col-md-6 col-lg-8 col-xl-10 col-xxl-12> Chicken</div>
                    <div class=col-xs-2 col-sm-4 col-md-6 col-lg-8 col-xl-10 col-xxl-12> Burgers</div>
                    <div class=col-xs-2 col-sm-4 col-md-6 col-lg-8 col-xl-10 col-xxl-12> Boneless wings</div>
                    <div class=col-xs-2 col-sm-4 col-md-6 col-lg-8 col-xl-10 col-xxl-12> Chicken pot pie</div>
                    <div class=col-xs-2 col-sm-4 col-md-6 col-lg-8 col-xl-10 col-xxl-12> Your wife's cooking</div>
                    </div class>
                </div class="container">
            </div class="containerfluid"> 
### </li>
